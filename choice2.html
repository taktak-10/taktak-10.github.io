<h1>New Life</h1>

<p>James's grand father revealed that he was the legendary supernova fighter, who fought through the biggest supernova in the galaxy's history!
 James trained with him all day and night and learned some of his important skills and knowledge. 
 When the academy started, James had no problem with keeping up with the trainings. 
However, he had hard time understanding the lectures and communicating with the teachers and classmates because Paldean language was not like anything he had expected.
Paldeans didn't talk to each other like humans, but instead, they used dance to communicate! James did not really consider himseld as a great dancer.</p>


<p><a href="choice5.html">He decided to use a dancing translator in class.</a></p>

<p><a href="choice7.html">He found some human students who are from Johto and stuck with them.</a></p>

<p><a href="choice4.html">He told himself. "Don't be afraid! Just dance!".</a></p>
