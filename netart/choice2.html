<h1>New Life</h1>

<p>Shohei's grand father was a legendary supernova fighter! When the academy started, Shohei was confident in his ability as a supernova fighter because he had been trained by his grandfather. 
However, he struggled in class because he couldn't communicate with them. 
Paldeans didn't talk to each other like Shohei did, but instead, they used dance to communicate! Shohei wasn't really a great dancer.</p>


<p><a href="choice5.html">He decided to use a translator in class.</a></p>

<p><a href="choice7.html">He found some students who are also from the planet Johto and stuck with them.</a></p>

<p><a href="choice4.html">He told himself. "Don't be afraid! Just dance!".</a></p>
